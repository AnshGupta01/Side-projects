# Backend Spring-boot application
I created this project to kickstart knowledge about Spring-boot and MongoDB and their various functionalities. This is a project to handle a movie database, and add reviews, it is focused upon implementation of core services like REST-API, JDBC and more. I've also used PostMan for testing of my APIs.
