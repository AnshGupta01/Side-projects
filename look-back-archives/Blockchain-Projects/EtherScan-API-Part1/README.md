# Wallet Information Fetcher
This Project is Part 1 of the project made for CyberCup 3.0 Hackathon held at Amity University Noida on 13th-14th October 2023

This is a Node.js script that fetches information about a cryptocurrency wallet using the Etherscan API. It retrieves the wallet's balance and recent transactions, displaying the results in the console. The script runs at regular intervals using setInterval to keep the data up to date.

# Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your system.
An Etherscan API key. You can obtain this key by signing up on the Etherscan website and creating an API key.

# Getting Started

- Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
- Open the script in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
- Replace the placeholder values with your actual wallet address and Etherscan API key.
- Save your changes.
- Running the Script using ```node script.js```

This will start the script, which will fetch wallet information at regular intervals (every 10 seconds) and display the results in the console.

# Note
This script is designed for educational purposes and as a starting point for fetching wallet information using the Etherscan API. You can further customize it to suit your needs or integrate it into other projects.
Remember to keep your API key and wallet address confidential and never share them in public repositories or with unauthorized users.
